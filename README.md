# timer
A simple countdown-timer for bash in linux.

This is a simple script for bash to show a countdown in the command line. This script is mi first and I did it to learn some bash.

You need to install mplayer (in Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install mplayer) and a sound file for the alarm ring.

I used, to made the script, the help from:

http://superuser.com/questions/611538/is-there-a-way-to-display-a-countdown-or-stopwatch-timer-in-a-terminal

https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial

USE

Call the script with an integer to start a normal countdown or with the "p" parameter to select diferent options.

Feel free to use this script in your own way.
